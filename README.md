Parse yahoo finance for company summaries using ticker symbols

Simply wanted to automate a very mundane step in my investment process. This program is very simple, it takes input of as many tickers as you want and prints out all the company summaries on to a blank file. Once I have more time, I will be continuing to touch up this code and make it more user friendly, but for the time being it gets the job done. 

Some important features that still must be added:
1)Being able to accept a CSV file of tickers as command line input
2)Exception catching for incorrect input
3)Make output into html format to give me more control in the aesthetic of the output
4)Scrub the input for duplicates

Long-term I was thinking of adding additional functionality that could supplement the summaries. I'm thinking something along hte line of adding some value investing fundamentals such as Earnings Yeild and Return on Capital with their respective statistics i.e trend, average, std. deviation, growth, etc.
